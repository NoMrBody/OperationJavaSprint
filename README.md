## Simple Kotlin Interpreter
<b>Project Overview:</b>
This project is a Java-based interpreter for a minimal subset of the Kotlin programming language. It supports basic programming constructs such as variable assignments, arithmetic operations, conditionals, and iterative control flow (while loop). The interpreter demonstrates its functionality by executing predefined algorithms.

###  Interpreter Capabilities:

- Lexer for tokenizing input
- Parser for building syntax tree
- Evaluator for executing syntax tree nodes
- Detection of some syntax errors
- Execution of predefined algorithms for demonstration

### Predefined algorithms
Predefined algorithms are included as text files in the [src/main/resources/algorithms] directory.
