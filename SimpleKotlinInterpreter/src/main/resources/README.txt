folder 'algorithms' contains algorithms written in Kotlin subset language.
In the main class, it is possible to run algorithm by specifying file name.
If needed, input of the algorithms can be modified within .txt file and executed after it.
Also, it is possible to create String variable, then assign a copy of an algorithm code to the variable and
    execute in this way. The sequence of digesting input is already written in Main.java

! IMPORTANT
Be advised that interpreter perceives boolean values as ones and zeros.
    true means 1
    false means 0

For example "checkpalindromenumber" determines whether inputted number is palindrome or not.
The function should return boolean value.
If inputted number is palindrome interpreter prints 1 (true) in the console, otherwise prints 0 (false).
